The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the calculation involves units that are not compatible, such as mixing percentages and pixels directly. For example, `width: calc(50% + 10px);` is valid, but `width: calc(50% + 10%);` may lead to inconsistencies across different viewport sizes. The issue arises because percentage values depend on their parent element's size, which can change unexpectedly when interacting with pixel values.
